## Cozmo Reacts to Speech
You can call out to cozmo and he will look for you to begin interacting with you. He will analyse your speech and react accordingly. 
A simple Naive Bayes algorithm classifies your speech into positive / negative emotions and cozmo reacts appropriately. 
For example, “I hate you” evokes sad emotions from cozmo and saying “I’m sorry” or “I’ve missed you” makes him happy.
